## ![](logo.png) Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps.Clustering 

This library brings support for clustering for library [Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps](https://github.com/amay077/Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps)

## Usage 

To use the library you only need to add the following line to `AssemlyInfo.cs` or `Main.cs`/`MainActivity.cs` file in your Android and iOS projects. It overrides the default MapRenderer provided in `Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps` and add awesome clustering funcionality :)

```csharp
[assembly: ExportRenderer(typeof(ClusteredMap), typeof(ClusteredMapRenderer))]
``` 

## Releases

See [RELEASE_NOTES](RELEASE_NOTES.md).
